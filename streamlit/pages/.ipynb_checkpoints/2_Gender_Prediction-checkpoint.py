st.write("LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is an algorithm used for topic modeling, a method that helps uncover the hidden themes and patterns within a collection of documents. It's like having a detective investigating a library full of books, trying to figure out the different topics covered. LDA assumes that each document is a mixture of various topics, and each topic is characterized by a distribution of words. By carefully examining the words and their frequencies, LDA helps us identify and understand the underlying themes present in the documents. It's a powerful tool for organizing and making sense of large volumes of text data.")
